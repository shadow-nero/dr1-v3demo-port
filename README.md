# dr1-v3demo-port
This repository is dedicated to developing a modding concept aimed at porting the free demo of Danganronpa V3 Killing Harmony into the structure of Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc (DR1). It will serve as a workspace for scripts, edited files, documentation, and experiments related to the adaptation process.
